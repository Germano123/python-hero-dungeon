# Introduction to Heroes

Heroes are at the heart of the **Hero Evolution Algorithm Project**. They are more than just characters; they are evolving entities that embody the strength and creativity of algorithmic design. Each hero is generated with unique attributes, bringing a diverse range of capabilities and potential to the fight against the dungeon's endless waves of monsters.

## The Role of Heroes

Every hero plays a vital role in the quest to find the ultimate defender. Starting as randomly generated individuals, heroes grow stronger and more specialized over successive generations. Their performance in battle, as well as their inherited traits, are carefully analyzed and refined to create the next generation of champions.

### Key Characteristics

Each hero is defined by a set of core attributes:

- **Strength**: The raw power used to deal damage.
- **Dexterity**: Agility and precision that influence attacks and evasion.
- **Vigor**: Overall stamina and resilience.
- **Intelligence**: Strategic and magical abilities.
- **Resistance**: Defense against physical and magical attacks.

These attributes shape how heroes perform in battle and influence their potential for survival and growth.

## What Lies Ahead?

In the following sections, we will dive deeper into:

- **[Attributes](2%20attributes.md)**: A closer look at each attribute and how it impacts a hero's performance.
- **[Algorithms](3%20algorithms.md)**: The mechanics behind hero generation, evolution, and selection for the next generation.

Heroes are the foundation of this project, and their development is a testament to the power of evolutionary design. Let us embark on this journey to create the ultimate hero together!
