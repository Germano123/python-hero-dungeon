# Hero Attributes

Attributes define the essence of a hero's capabilities, shaping their performance in battles and determining their potential for evolution. In the **Hero Evolution Algorithm Project**, each hero is characterized by five primary attributes that influence their effectiveness and survival within the dungeon.

## Primary Attributes

1. **Strength**
    - Represents the hero's physical power.
    - Directly impacts the amount of damage dealt to enemies.

2. **Dexterity**
    - Reflects agility and precision.
    - Enhances the hero's chances to evade attacks and improves critical hit probabilities.

3. **Vigor**
    - Measures stamina and endurance.
    - Determines the hero's health pool, affecting how much damage they can withstand.

4. **Intelligence**
    - Signifies strategic thinking and magical prowess.
    - Boosts magical damage and enhances abilities requiring mental acuity.

5. **Resistance**
    - Represents the hero's defenses against physical and magical attacks.
    - Reduces incoming damage and increases survivability.

## Dynamic Interplay

Each attribute contributes to the hero's overall fitness score, which evaluates their capability to adapt and survive in the dungeon. Balancing these attributes is crucial for creating a well-rounded hero or specializing them for specific roles, such as tanking, damage dealing, or magic casting.
