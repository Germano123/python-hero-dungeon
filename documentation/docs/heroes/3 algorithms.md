# Hero Evolution Algorithms

The core of the **Hero Evolution Algorithm Project** lies in the evolutionary process that creates stronger, more adaptive heroes over time. By applying principles inspired by biological evolution, the system refines each generation of heroes to maximize their potential.

## The Evolutionary Process

The evolution of heroes is driven by three main components:

### 1. **Fitness Evaluation**
   - Each hero is assigned a **fitness score** based on their performance in the dungeon.
   - Fitness considers attributes like Strength, Dexterity, Vigor, and their success in battles.
   - Heroes with higher fitness are more likely to contribute to the next generation.

### 2. **Selection**
   - The system selects the best-performing heroes as "parents" for the next generation.
   - Selection methods prioritize diversity while favoring high-fitness individuals to avoid stagnation.

### 3. **Crossover and Mutation**
   - **Crossover**: Combines traits from two parent heroes to create new offspring. This introduces variety while preserving strengths from previous generations.
   - **Mutation**: Randomly alters certain attributes of offspring heroes. This helps introduce novel traits and prevents the population from becoming too homogeneous.

## Generational Advancement

After creating a new generation of heroes:

- The new heroes are evaluated in the dungeon to determine their fitness.
- The evolutionary cycle continues, with each generation striving to improve on the last.
- Over time, the process aims to produce heroes capable of conquering even the toughest dungeon challenges.
