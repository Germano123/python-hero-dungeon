# Hero Evolution Algorithm Project

Welcome to the **Hero Evolution Algorithm Project**, an ambitious game development experiment aimed at combining evolutionary algorithms with strategic dungeon crawling mechanics. This project explores cutting-edge techniques to create heroes capable of tackling endless hordes of dungeon monsters while refining their abilities through generations of evolutionary progress.

## Overview

The project is a blend of **game mechanics** and **algorithmic research**, designed to challenge and excite game developers and AI enthusiasts alike. Through gameplay, the system evolves heroes to achieve the ultimate goal: discovering a hero capable of defending against infinite waves of dungeon monsters.

### Main Features

1. **Hero Evolution**: Heroes are generated with random attributes and evolve over time using fitness-based selection, crossover, and mutation. Each generation builds on the strengths of the previous, seeking to create a more powerful lineage.

2. **Dungeon Mechanics**: The dungeon features infinite floors with progressively tougher monsters. Heroes gain experience and levels by defeating these monsters, testing their abilities and resilience.

3. **Strategic Progression**: Players observe and guide the evolutionary process, aiming to refine heroes' abilities to overcome increasingly challenging obstacles.

### Why This Matters

This project demonstrates how **evolutionary algorithms** can be applied in game design to create dynamic, engaging systems. It also highlights the potential for integrating artificial intelligence concepts into interactive entertainment, making this both a technical and creative exploration.

## What's Next?

Dive into the following sections for detailed insights:

- [Heroes](heroes/1%20intro.md): Learn about hero attributes, algorithms for generation, and their progression.
- [Dungeon](dungeon/1%20mechanics.md): Explore the infinite dungeon's mechanics and combat system.
- [Evolution](evolution/1%20intro.md): Understand the evolutionary principles driving the hero development process.
- [Interface](interface/1%20hud_menus.md): See how heroes, dungeons, and progress are represented visually.

Together, these components form the foundation of an engaging idle-style game where the quest for the ultimate hero never ends.
