> - Implement unique traits that make certain heroes stand out in specific scenarios.  

- **Improve Documentation**  
> - Expand tutorials for contributors.  
> - Include visual aids for complex mechanics (e.g., evolution diagrams).

## Q2: Expanding Dungeon Mechanics  

- **Dynamic Dungeon Scaling**  
> - Introduce traps, environmental effects, and procedurally generated dungeon layouts.  
> - Scale monster abilities and behavior to match hero growth.  

- **Dungeon Events**  
> - Add random events (e.g., treasure rooms, ambushes, or boss battles).  
> - Introduce a mini-boss every 10 floors and a major boss every 50 floors.

## Q4: Community Engagement and Polishing  

- **Community Features**  
> - Launch a leaderboard system to track top-performing heroes and teams.  
> - Add the ability to share heroes and their stats with the community.  

- **Polish and Balancing**  
> - Balance dungeon difficulty, hero scaling, and combat mechanics.  
> - Focus on performance optimizations to ensure smooth gameplay.  

- **Release a Playable Beta**  
> - Release a beta version of the game for community testing and feedback.  
> - Gather insights to refine the final version.
