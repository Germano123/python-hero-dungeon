Each floor introduces new threats and increasing difficulty, ensuring that only the strongest heroes survive and progress. Infinite Floors The dungeon consists of an infinite number of floors. Heroes advance floor by floor, facing increasingly powerful enemies as they ascend. The endless nature of the dungeon ensures that no hero's potential is capped, providing a continuous challenge for evaluating fitness and growth. Floor Progression Scaling Difficulty : Each floor features enemies whose levels increase gradually. Every 10 floors, the level of enemies scales more significantly, ensuring a steep increase in difficulty over time. Rewards : Heroes gain experience points (XP) for defeating enemies, which contribute to their level progression and fitness score. Enemy Creatures Each floor of the dungeon spawns a single enemy creature: Randomized Levels : Enemy levels are determined based on the current floor, with higher floors generating more powerful foes. Strength and Abilities : Enemies become more challenging as their levels increase, incorporating stronger attributes and abilities to test the heroes' limits. Hero Interaction Combat : Heroes engage in battle with the enemy creature on their current floor. Combat performance determines whether they advance or are defeated. Leveling System : Heroes gain XP equal to the enemy's level upon victory. They level up according to the formula: XP >= 5 * Hero Level When this threshold is reached, the hero advances to the next level, improving their attributes and fitness. Defeat : If a hero is defeated, their progress is recorded, including the floor they reached and their final fitness score. This data is used to refine future generations. What\u2019s Next?

Each battle pits a hero against an enemy creature, with turns alternating based on agility. Combat Mechanics Turn Order Turn order is determined by the Agility attribute of both the hero and the enemy. The combatant with the higher agility takes the first turn. In the case of a tie, the hero always goes first. Attacking On their turn, the combatant (hero or enemy) deals damage to their opponent. The damage dealt is based on the Strength attribute: Damage = Strength Health Management Both the hero and the enemy have a Health attribute. Each attack reduces the opponent's health by the damage amount calculated. Combat ends when one combatant's health reaches zero or below. Victory and Defeat Victory If the hero defeats the enemy: The hero earns experience points (XP) equal to the enemy's level. The hero progresses to the next dungeon floor to face a stronger enemy. Defeat If the enemy defeats the hero: The hero's progress is recorded, including their fitness score and the floor they reached. The hero's data is used to refine the evolution algorithm for future generations. Simplified Example Hero vs. Enemy: Hero: Health = 50, Strength = 12, Agility = 8 Enemy: Health = 40, Strength = 10, Agility = 6 Turn Order: The hero attacks first (Agility = 8 > 6). Combat Flow: Turn 1: Hero deals 12 damage to the enemy (Enemy Health = 28). Turn 2: Enemy deals 10 damage to the hero (Hero Health = 40). Repeat until one combatant's health is zero or below.

By applying principles of evolutionary algorithms, heroes adapt and improve over successive generations, paving the way for the ultimate hero capable of conquering the endless dungeon. Why Evolution? Evolution allows us to: Simulate Adaptation : Heroes evolve to overcome the challenges posed by progressively stronger dungeon enemies. Discover Potential : Through generations, heroes with unique combinations of attributes emerge, highlighting exceptional potential. Optimize Over Time : By applying fitness-based selection, we ensure that the best traits are carried forward, leading to stronger and more capable heroes. How It Works 1. Initial Population The process begins with an initial population of randomly generated heroes. Each hero has randomly assigned attributes, including: Strength : Determines physical damage dealt. Dexterity : Influences agility and turn order. Vigor : Affects health and survivability. Intelligence : Governs critical thinking and decision-making (future implementation). Resistance : Improves defense against attacks. 2. Fitness Evaluation Each hero is tested in the dungeon, and their performance determines their fitness score. The fitness score is calculated based on: Dungeon Progress : The floor reached before defeat. Combat Efficiency : The ability to deal damage while minimizing damage received. Level Advancement : The hero's level at the time of defeat. 3. Selection Heroes with higher fitness scores are more likely to be selected as parents for the next generation. This ensures that the strongest traits are preserved and passed on. 4. Crossover During reproduction, two parent heroes combine their DNA to create offspring. Attributes from both parents are mixed to produce a new hero with inherited traits. For example: Parent 1: High Strength, Low Dexterity Parent 2: Low Strength, High Dexterity Offspring: Balanced Strength and Dexterity 5. Mutation To maintain diversity and introduce variability, mutations occur randomly in offspring. These mutations can: Slightly increase or decrease an attribute. Introduce unexpected traits, such as higher resistance or unique attribute combinations. 6. Iteration This process repeats for multiple generations. Over time, heroes become more specialized, with attributes fine-tuned for overcoming the dungeon\u2019s escalating challenges. Example Cycle Generation 1 : 100 random heroes are generated. Evaluation : Each hero is tested in the dungeon, and their fitness scores are recorded. Selection : The top 20% of heroes are selected as parents. Reproduction : Offspring are created via crossover and mutation. Generation 2 : A new generation of 100 heroes is created. Repeat : The cycle continues until the desired performance level is achieved. What\u2019s Next?

By quantifying a hero's performance, we identify the strongest candidates to carry their traits into the next generation. What is Fitness? Fitness is a numerical score that reflects a hero's overall effectiveness in combat, survivability, and progression within the dungeon. This score is used to: Rank Heroes : Identify which heroes performed best during their trials. Guide Selection : Determine which heroes will become parents for the next generation. Measure Progress : Track improvements across generations. Fitness Criteria A hero\u2019s fitness score is calculated using multiple factors: 1. Dungeon Progression Definition : The number of floors a hero successfully clears before being defeated. Weight : Heavily weighted since progression reflects adaptability and strength. 2. Combat Performance Damage Efficiency : The ratio of damage dealt to damage taken. Consistency : Ability to sustain performance across multiple encounters. Critical Hits : The frequency and impact of critical strikes (future implementation). 3. Level Advancement Experience Points (XP) : Gained by defeating enemies; used to calculate the hero\u2019s level. Level Growth : Heroes that reach higher levels during their dungeon run are rewarded with higher fitness scores. Fitness Formula The fitness score is calculated using the following formula: Fitness = (Dungeon Progression * Weight1) + (Damage Efficiency * Weight2) + (Level Growth * Weight3) Example Weights: Dungeon Progression: 50% Damage Efficiency: 30% Level Growth: 20% These weights can be adjusted to prioritize specific traits based on gameplay goals. Example Calculation Hero Performance : Floors Cleared: 15 Damage Dealt: 1000 Damage Taken: 250 Level Reached: 5 Metrics : Dungeon Progression = 15 Damage Efficiency = 1000 / 250 = 4.0 Level Growth = 5 Formula Application : Fitness = (15 * 0.5) + (4.0 * 0.3) + (5 * 0.2) = 7.5 + 1.2 + 1.0 = 9.7 Fitness Score : 9.7 Adapting the Formula The formula can be tailored to fit different priorities: Combat-Focused Heroes : Increase the weight for Damage Efficiency.

These processes ensure genetic diversity, allowing for the emergence of powerful heroes capable of overcoming the dungeon\u2019s challenges. What is Crossover? Crossover is a process where two parent heroes combine their attributes to create offspring. This simulates genetic inheritance, blending traits from both parents to produce unique heroes. Crossover Process Selection of Parents : Two parent heroes are selected based on their fitness scores. Higher fitness scores increase the likelihood of being selected, but randomization ensures diversity. Attribute Mixing : Each attribute (e.g., strength, dexterity) is inherited based on a weighted average or randomly chosen from one of the parents. Example: Parent 1 Strength: 15 Parent 2 Strength: 10 Offspring Strength: Randomly between 10 and 15 or calculated as an average (e.g., 12.5). Special Traits : Rare traits or abilities may have a small chance to transfer fully from one parent. What is Mutation? Mutation introduces randomness into the offspring\u2019s attributes, ensuring variety and the potential for unexpected heroes with extraordinary traits. Mutation Process Probability : Each attribute has a small chance (e.g., 5%) to mutate. The mutation rate can be adjusted to balance gameplay. Value Changes : Mutations slightly increase or decrease an attribute within a predefined range. Example: Base Strength: 12 Mutation: +3 Final Strength: 15 Rare Mutations : Occasionally, mutations can result in extreme changes, such as doubling an attribute or unlocking unique abilities. Example Workflow Select Parents : Hero A (Strength: 14, Dexterity: 10, Vigor: 12) Hero B (Strength: 12, Dexterity: 14, Vigor: 11) Crossover : Offspring inherits: Strength: Average of 14 and 12 = 13 Dexterity: Randomly chosen = 10 Vigor: Average of 12 and 11 = 11.5 Mutation : Dexterity mutates: +2 Final Dexterity: 12 Result : Offspring Attributes: Strength = 13, Dexterity = 12, Vigor = 11.5 Visualizing Crossover and Mutation Here are suggestions for visual aids: 1.

Let us embark on this journey to create the ultimate hero together!","title":"What Lies Ahead?"},{"location":"heroes/2%20attributes/","text":"Hero Attributes Attributes define the essence of a hero's capabilities, shaping their performance in battles and determining their potential for evolution. In the Hero Evolution Algorithm Project , each hero is characterized by five primary attributes that influence their effectiveness and survival within the dungeon. Primary Attributes Strength Represents the hero's physical power. Directly impacts the amount of damage dealt to enemies. Dexterity Reflects agility and precision. Enhances the hero's chances to evade attacks and improves critical hit probabilities. Vigor Measures stamina and endurance. Determines the hero's health pool, affecting how much damage they can withstand. Intelligence Signifies strategic thinking and magical prowess. Boosts magical damage and enhances abilities requiring mental acuity. Resistance Represents the hero's defenses against physical and magical attacks. Reduces incoming damage and increases survivability. Dynamic Interplay Each attribute contributes to the hero's overall fitness score, which evaluates their capability to adapt and survive in the dungeon. Balancing these attributes is crucial for creating a well-rounded hero or specializing them for specific roles, such as tanking, damage dealing, or magic casting. What's Next?

By applying principles inspired by biological evolution, the system refines each generation of heroes to maximize their potential. The Evolutionary Process The evolution of heroes is driven by three main components: 1. Fitness Evaluation Each hero is assigned a fitness score based on their performance in the dungeon. Fitness considers attributes like Strength, Dexterity, Vigor, and their success in battles. Heroes with higher fitness are more likely to contribute to the next generation. 2. Selection The system selects the best-performing heroes as \"parents\" for the next generation. Selection methods prioritize diversity while favoring high-fitness individuals to avoid stagnation. 3. Crossover and Mutation Crossover : Combines traits from two parent heroes to create new offspring. This introduces variety while preserving strengths from previous generations. Mutation : Randomly alters certain attributes of offspring heroes. This helps introduce novel traits and prevents the population from becoming too homogeneous. Generational Advancement After creating a new generation of heroes: The new heroes are evaluated in the dungeon to determine their fitness. The evolutionary cycle continues, with each generation striving to improve on the last. Over time, the process aims to produce heroes capable of conquering even the toughest dungeon challenges. What's Next? Discover how these heroes interact with the dungeon's mechanics in the Dungeon Mechanics section, or revisit the Attributes to see what makes each hero unique.","title":"Algorithms"},{"location":"heroes/3%20algorithms/#hero-evolution-algorithms","text":"The core of the Hero Evolution Algorithm Project lies in the evolutionary process that creates stronger, more adaptive heroes over time.
